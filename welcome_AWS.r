#                      Welcome to Biodiversity Data at Your Fingertips: in the cloud
#
####################################################################################################

# This workshop will introduce participants to the Vermont Atlas of Life's community science data 
# stored at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) submitted through various platforms
# such as eBird.org, iNaturalist.org, OdonataCentral.org, and eButterfly.org. Participants will get
# hands-on experience analyzing community science observations, from creating species lists to 
# mapping species distributions. The objective of the workshop is to introduce and 
# provide participants with working examples of how to use R to access, analyze and plot community 
# science data.

# Most of the spatial layers that we'll use in the workshop are already available on this machine. 
# The "../Spatial_Layers" folder was intentionally placed so that the code for the workshop doesn't 
# need to be altered. While you can't see the actual folder in your 'home' drive, it's there just
# one folder up hence the "../" in the file code. 

# You're currently running RStudio through Amazon Web Services. All participants are sharing the
# memory (72gb) and spatial layers. Please be mindful of that before writing / removing files from the
# "../Spatial_Layers" folder. 

# RUNNING CODE - To run lines of code you need to physically press the Run key in the upper right
# of the Scripts window. The familiar shortcuts ('ctrl-r' for example) don't work. You will notice
# that the page refreshes if you use the shortcut but the code won't run. 

# BE SURE TO EXPORT YOUR SCRIPTS AT THE END OF THE WORKSHOP!!
# I'll be stopping Amazon Web Services after the course is finished. At that point, the scripts you 
# save on the server will be deleted. You can download any files you save to the server by expanding
# the 'more' button in the Files tab. Select the file/s you want to download and click 'Export'. 

# Good luck, happy coding & I hope you learn something new!
