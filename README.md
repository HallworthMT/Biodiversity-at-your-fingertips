# Biodiversity at your fingertips

This workshop will introduce participants to the [Vermont Atlas of Life's](https://val.vtecostudies.org/) community science data stored at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) submitted through various platforms such as [eBird](https://ebird.org/vt/home), [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org), [OdonataCentral](https://www.odonatacentral.org), and [eButterfly](www.e-butterfly.org). Participants will get hands-on experience analyzing community science observations, from creating species lists to mapping species distributions. The workshop will be taught using [R, a free, open-source statistical computing program](www.r-project.org). Participants are encouraged to be familiar with R to get the most out of the workshop. A laptop is required for participation.
